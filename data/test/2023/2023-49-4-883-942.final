variation	I
across	O

Recent	O
work	O
has	O
focused	O
on	O
larger	O
areas	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
cities	O
or	O
counties	O
,	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
enough	O
social	O
media	O
data	O
is	O
available	O
in	O
each	O
area	O

but	O
larger	O
areas	O
have	O
a	O
limited	O
ability	O
to	O
find	O
fine-grained	O
distinctions	O

such	O
as	O
intracity	O

We	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
embed	B
smaller	O

which	O
can	O

We	O

The	O
issue	O
with	O
modeling	B

use	O
in	O
small	O
areas	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
data	O
becomes	O
incredibly	O
sparse	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
areas	O
having	O
scant	O
social	O

We	O
propose	O
a	O
novel	O
embedding	B
approach	O
that	O
alternates	O
training	O
with	O
smoothing	O

which	O
mitigates	O
these	O

We	O
focus	O
on	O
linguistic	B
variation	I
across	O
Texas	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
relatively	O
understudied	O

We	O
develop	O
two	O
novel	O
quantitative	O
evaluations	O
that	O
measure	O
how	O
well	O
the	O
embeddings	B
can	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
capture	O
linguistic	B
variation	I
.	O
The	O
first	O
evaluation	O
measures	O
how	O
well	O
a	O
model	O
can	O
map	O
a	O
dialect	O
given	O
terms	O
specific	O
to	O
that	O
dialect	O
.	O
The	O
second	O
evaluation	O
measures	O
how	O
well	O
a	O
model	O
can	O
map	O
preference	O
of	O
lexical	B
variants	I
.	O
These	O
evaluations	O
show	O
how	O
embedding	B
models	I
could	O
be	O
used	O
directly	O
by	O
sociolinguists	B
and	O
measure	O
how	O
much	O
sociolinguistic	B
information	O
is	O
contained	O
within	O
the	O
embeddings	B
.	O
We	O
complement	O
this	O
second	O
evaluation	O
with	O
a	O
methodology	O
for	O
using	O
embeddings	B
as	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
genetic	O
code	O
where	O
we	O
identify	O
“	O
genes	B
”	O
that	O
correspond	O
to	O
a	O
sociological	B
variable	I
and	O
connect	O
those	O
“	O
genes	O
”	O
to	O
a	O
linguistic	B
phenomenon	O
thereby	O
connecting	O
sociological	B
phenomena	B

linguistic	B
ones	O
