We 	 O
propose 	 O
an 	 O
explainable 	 B
approach 	 I
for 	 O
relation 	 B
extraction 	 I
that 	 O
mitigates 	 O
the 	 O
tension 	 O
between 	 O
generalization 	 B
and 	 O
explainability 	 B
by 	 O
jointly 	 O
training 	 B
for 	 O
the 	 O
two 	 O
goals 	 O
. 	 O
Our 	 O
approach 	 O
uses 	 O
a 	 O
multi 	 B

task 	 I
learning 	 B
architecture 	 I
, 	 O
which 	 O
jointly 	 O
trains 	 O
a 	 O
classifier 	 B
for 	 O
relation 	 B
extraction 	 I
, 	 O
and 	 O
a 	 O
sequence 	 B
model 	 I
that 	 O
labels 	 O
words 	 B
in 	 O
the 	 O
context 	 O
of 	 O
the 	 O
relations 	 O
that 	 O
explain 	 O
the 	 O

of 	 O
the 	 O

We 	 O
also 	 O
convert 	 O
the 	 O
model 	 B

to 	 O
rules 	 B

bring 	 O
global 	 B
explanations 	 I
to 	 O
this 	 O
approach 	 O
. 	 O
This 	 O
sequence 	 B
model 	 I
is 	 O
trained 	 O
using 	 O
a 	 O
hybrid 	 B
strategy 	 I
: 	 O
supervised 	 B

when 	 O
supervision 	 B

otherwise 	 O

In 	 O
the 	 O
latter 	 O
situation 	 O

we 	 O
treat 	 O
the 	 O
sequence 	 B
model 	 I
 s 	 O
labels 	 O
as 	 O

and 	 O
learn 	 O
the 	 O

assignment 	 O
that 	 O
maximizes 	 O
the 	 O
performance 	 B
of 	 O
the 	 O

We 	 O
evaluate 	 O
the 	 O
proposed 	 O
approach 	 O
on 	 O
the 	 O
two 	 O
datasets 	 B
and 	 O
show 	 O
that 	 O
the 	 O
sequence 	 B
model 	 I
provides 	 O

that 	 O
serve 	 O
as 	 O

that 	 O
the 	 O

generally 	 O
improves 	 O
the 	 O

We 	 O
also 	 O
evaluate 	 O
